# Technical Architecture

Resolv is built on a robust and scalable technical architecture that seamlessly integrates blockchain technology with user-friendly interfaces. This section outlines the key components of our system and how they work together to provide a secure and efficient platform for protecting and managing crypto assets.

## Overview

The architecture of Resolv is designed with modularity and scalability in mind. It consists of several key components:

- **Smart Contracts**: The backbone of our platform, these contracts handle the core functionalities such as asset protection, dispute resolution, and fund recovery.
- **Frontend Application**: A user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with our smart contracts easily.
- **Backend Services** (if applicable): Supporting services that enhance the functionality of the frontend and smart contracts, such as notification services, off-chain computations, etc.

## Smart Contract Layer

Our smart contracts, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, are central to the core operations of the platform. Written in Solidity, they are meticulously crafted to ensure security and efficiency.

### Key Components

- **Asset Protection Logic**: Our smart contracts include mechanisms to secure user assets against unauthorized access and theft.
- **Dispute Resolution Mechanism**: We have implemented a transparent and fair dispute resolution process within the smart contracts.
- **Fund Recovery Process**: These contracts facilitate the recovery and return of funds to users following successful dispute resolution.

### WrappedERC20 Contract

A cornerstone of our platform is the `WrappedERC20` smart contract. This contract plays a pivotal role in the functionality of Resolv, handling critical aspects of token wrapping and recoverable transactions.

For those interested in the technical intricacies of the `WrappedERC20` contract, we provide a detailed breakdown in our dedicated documentation. This includes specifics on its design, features, and functionalities.

## Frontend Layer

The frontend of Resolv is built using [Frontend Technology Stack], providing a seamless and intuitive user experience. It interacts with the ethereum blockchain through web3 technologies [details on web3 stack].

### Key Interactions

- **User Interface for Asset Protection**: How users can protect their assets through the frontend.
- **Dispute Submission Process**: Steps for users to submit disputes via the frontend.
- **Dashboard and Reporting**: Details on how users can track their assets and dispute statuses.

## Backend Layer (if applicable)

Our backend supports the frontend and blockchain layers by providing additional functionalities such as:

- 

## SAFE (if applicable)

## Security and Compliance

Resolv's architecture is built with a strong emphasis on security and compliance. We regularly conduct smart contract audits, adhere to best practices in web application security, and comply with relevant regulatory standards.

## Scalability and Performance

Our system is designed to be scalable, ensuring that it can handle a growing number of users and transactions without compromising performance.

## Future Enhancements

We are continuously working to improve and expand our platform. Check out our roadmap for Future updates
