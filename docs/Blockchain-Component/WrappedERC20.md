## Overview

The WrappedERC20 contract is an Ethereum-based smart contract designed to create a wrapped token, facilitating various functionalities such as minting, burning, and managing transactions with additional features for tracking and recovering tokens. This document provides a high-level overview of the key components and functionalities of the WrappedERC20 smart contract.

### Contract Features

1. **Token Minting and Burning:** Users can mint new tokens by sending ETH and burn tokens to reduce the total supply.
2. **Transaction Tracking and Recovery:** The contract provides mechanisms for tracking transactions and recovering tokens in case of unauthorized transfers.
3. **Freezing and Unfreezing Accounts:** The contract can freeze and unfreeze accounts related to suspicious transactions for further investigation.
4. **Governance Voting:** Incorporates a governance mechanism for decisions on recovering funds from fraudulent transactions.
5. **ERC20 Compliance:** The contract adheres to the ERC20 standard, ensuring compatibility with standard ERC20 functionalities like transferring tokens, approving token spend by another account, and querying balances and allowances.

### Contract Key Functionality

#### Minting and Burning

- `_mint(address _account, uint256 _amount, uint256 _ethAmount)`: Mints tokens to a specified account.
- `_burn(address account, uint256 amount)`: Burns a specified amount of tokens from an account.

#### Transaction Management

- `_approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount)`: Approves a spender to use a specified amount of the owner's tokens.
- `_spendAllowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount)`: Deducts a specified amount from the spender's allowance.

#### Tracking and Recovery

- `_freeze(Spenditure memory _txDetails, uint256 _txId)`: Initiates tracking of a transaction.
- `_freezeAccounts(Spenditure memory _txDetails, uint256 _txId)`: Freezes accounts involved in a transaction.
- `_recoverFunds(Spenditure memory _txDetails, uint256 _txId, Vote _vote, address _recoveryAccount)`: Recovers funds based on governance voting.

#### Account and Transaction Reset

- `_reset(address _owner)`: Resets an account by burning tokens, deleting transaction records, and returning ETH.

#### ERC20 Standard Functions

- `name()`, `symbol()`, `decimals()`, `totalSupply()`, `balanceOf(address account)`, `allowance(address owner, address spender)`: Standard ERC20 functions for token details and balances.

### Additional Information

- **Transaction Structure:** The contract uses a `Spenditure` struct to record transaction details, including sender, receiver, amount, and transaction status.
- **Governance Vote:** Decisions on fund recovery are made through a governance vote, categorized as `Vote.YES` or `Vote.NO`.
- **Freezing Mechanism:** Freezing accounts helps prevent further unauthorized transactions, pending investigation.
- **Error Handling:** The contract includes require statements for error handling and validation.

### Use Case Scenarios

1. **Token Minting:** Users can mint tokens in exchange for ETH, facilitating a token-ETH swap mechanism.
2. **Fraud Prevention:** In case of unauthorized transactions, the contract can freeze accounts and initiate a recovery process.
3. **ERC20 Integration:** Being ERC20 compliant, it can be integrated into wallets, exchanges, and other platforms that support ERC20 tokens.
